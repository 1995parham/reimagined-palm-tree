# Students' Portal

## Introduction

I had started my journey to computer programming in high school but my first actual programming course was **Introduction to Programming**
at the Amirkabir University of Tech. Fall of 2013.
The course was totally awesome with one of the best professors in the computer engineering faculty, [Prof. Bahador Bakhshi](https://github.com/bahador-bakhshi).
He introduced me to Linux, he always is kind to me and let me do the course project with Qt and C++.
He always uses C and from him, I was starting to use C instead of C++ or Java after the course.
The project was a student portal from the manager's view. manager can assign courses and etc.
I have stored the project here without modification for historical reasons.
